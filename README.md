# mynotes

Welcome to mynotes! A simple note-taking app that was made using ReactJS, DexieJS, and Electron. It runs like a regular desktop app. 
The database is derived from the application's IndexDB storage.

To get up and running, all you have to do is download the files and click on the 'mynotes.exe'. While this application has been bundled, I have nonetheless left
development files in the package for review, both for myself, and for anyone else who was curious. 

This app was mostly made to test out the Dexie platform with React and Electron. Consider it a test app. Especially since I completely 
forgot to add a 'Delete' feature.

My next venture into a note-taking application will no doubt be more in-depth.
